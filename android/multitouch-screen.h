 * need to know which one has sent us a touch event. This is important for proper

 * The callback will be called from one of the renderer's threads, so it may
 * require synchronization on any data structures it modifies. The pixels buffer
 * may be overwritten as soon as the callback returns.
 * The pixels buffer is intentionally not const: the callback may modify the data
 * without copying to another buffer if it wants, e.g. in-place RGBA to RGB
 * conversion, or in-place y-inversion.
 * Param:
 *   context        The pointer optionally provided when the callback was
 *                  registered. The client can use this to pass whatever
 *                  information it wants to the callback.
 *   width, height  Dimensions of the image, in pixels. Rows are tightly packed;
 *                  there is no inter-row padding.
 *   ydir           Indicates row order: 1 means top-to-bottom order, -1 means
 *                  bottom-to-top order.
 *   format, type   Format and type GL enums, as used in glTexImage2D() or
 *                  glReadPixels(), describing the pixel format.
 *   pixels         The framebuffer image.
 *
 * In the first implementation, ydir is always -1 (bottom to top), format and
 * type are always GL_RGBA and GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, and the width and height will
 * always be the same as the ones passed to initOpenGLRenderer().
