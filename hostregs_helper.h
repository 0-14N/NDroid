/* The GCC global register variable extension is used to reserve some
   host registers for use by generated code.  However only the core parts of
   the translation engine are compiled with these settings.  We must manually
   save/restore these registers when called from regular code.
   It is not sufficient to save/restore T0 et. al. as these may be declared
   with a datatype smaller than the actual register.  */
